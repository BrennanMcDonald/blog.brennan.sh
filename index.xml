I&amp;rsquo;m Brennan McDonald, a 4th year computer science student studying at the University of Ottawa in Canada. Knowledgeable in the art of the DOM and Front-end, I also have vast experience with a large list of topics in Computer Science. Right now I am working on expanding my knowledge in the field of DevOps, Availability, and Cloud Computing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This blog is going to simply be my shouting my thoughts into the void with the hope of improving my writing skills and picking up a few listeners along the way. I intend on talking about anything that comes to my mind and I hope that I can hit a topic that interests a few people.&lt;/p>
