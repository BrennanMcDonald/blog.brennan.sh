&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to write several blog posts for a while, but despite having inspiration I&amp;rsquo;ve failed to produce any content in 5 months. I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to write about a few topics I&amp;rsquo;ve been passionate about since the pandemic started with no avail. My posts always felt too short to qualify as a “blog post”, always feeling like I didn&amp;rsquo;t have enough content to deliver or my research wasn&amp;rsquo;t thorough enough.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then I found a post submitted to HackerNews. The post was maybe 500 words, two paragraphs, but the author conveyed their message efficiently. While I disagreed with the topic, I was still able to understand the author&amp;rsquo;s message in these two paragraphs. The length of a post shouldn&amp;rsquo;t determine it&amp;rsquo;s quality, instead, the contents of the post should speak for themselves.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>From now on, on this blog, I won&amp;rsquo;t concern myself with the length of a post. Instead, I will worry about conveying my message with efficiency; And actually writing the posts I want to write.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
