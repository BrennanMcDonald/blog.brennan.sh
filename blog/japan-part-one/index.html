I was lucky to find a deal from Vancouver to Tokyo on ANA which is one of the best airlines in the world, and it shows.</p><div class=figure><p><img src=https://blog.brennan.sh/img/japan/food.jpg alt="Eggs + Ground (pulled) salmon + shitakee mushroom cap, seaweed + Roe, Colslaw + Chicken"></p></div><h6 id=eggs--ground-pulled-salmon--shitakee-mushroom-cap-seaweed--roe-colslaw--chicken>Eggs + Ground (pulled) salmon + shitakee mushroom cap, seaweed + Roe, Colslaw + Chicken</h6><p>The service, food, and amenities provided by the airline were all at the top of their game. Even given the fact that the food was my first real taste of &ldquo;authentic&rdquo; Japanese food and it wasn&rsquo;t my best meal ever. One mistake I did make, was taking a drink from the flight attendants which was some thick, corn based drink, possible Corn Potage. All I can assume is it&rsquo;s an acquired taste.</p><div class=figure><p><img src=https://blog.brennan.sh/img/japan/tokyo-from-a-plane.jpg alt="Tokyo from a plane"></p></div><p>I managed to capture a cool picture of Tokyo from above, capturing the intense scale of the city.</p><h2 id=tokyo-first-days>Tokyo: First Days</h2><h3 id=day-0>Day 0</h3><p>Just after touching down, I took the JR Keikyū Airport Line and the Yamanote Line from the airport to Tokyo Station. I was already impressed with the quantity and quality of the intra-city transit by how easy it was to get on and off these trains.</p><div class=figure><p><img src=https://blog.brennan.sh/img/japan/tokyo-station.jpg alt="Tokyo Station"></p></div><h6 id=tokyo-station>Tokyo Station</h6><p>I decided to walk from the station to my hotel because after being placed in the center of Tokyo, I wanted to see as much as I could. This ended up being a great decision, not only did my route take my past the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo_Imperial_Palace>Tokyo Imperial Palace</a>, I got to see it illuminated.</p><div class=figure><p><img src=https://blog.brennan.sh/img/japan/palace-1.jpg alt="Tokyo Imperial Palace, Illuminated at night"></p></div><h6 id=tokyo-imperial-palace-illuminated-at-night>Tokyo Imperial Palace, Illuminated at night</h6><p>After getting to the hotel I walked Shinjuku 3 Chome around a bit but was quite exhausted so after about 45 minutes, I retired to my capsule hotel.</p><div class=figure><p><img src=https://blog.brennan.sh/img/japan/nine-hours.jpg alt="My capsule hotel, 9Hours"></p></div><h6 id=my-capsule-hotel-9hours>My capsule hotel, 9Hours</h6><p>Day one involved a lot of walking, and because i&rsquo;m some weird data horder, a year and a bit later I say I took 14,613 steps. I can also show you exactly on a map where I went. Obviously the data isnt perfect and there are some weird artifacts, but for the most part this is where I went.</p><div class=figure><p><img src=https://blog.brennan.sh/img/japan/too-much.png alt="My timeline for December 29th, 2018"></p></div><h6 id=my-timeline-for-december-29th-2018>My timeline for December 29th, 2018</h6><p>The day started off with me going from the hotel to Hanzomon Station, one again walking instead of taking transit as I personally find walking as the best way to experience a place. I could have taken the rail from my hotel to Shibuya but walking half allowed me to catch my first real sights of the city and some of the really cool architecture.</p><div class=figure><p><img src=https://blog.brennan.sh/img/japan/merge-one.png alt="Aquifer and Really cool building!"></p></div><h6 id=aquifer-and-really-cool-building>Aquifer and Really cool building!</h6><p>Day one was filled with exploring and getting comfortable with the sights and sounds of Tokyo. Wandering from the <a href=https://www.gotokyo.org/en/spot/78/index.html>scramble crossing</a>, to <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takeshita_Street>たけしたどり(Takeshita Dore)</a>, and finally visiting <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoyogi_Park>代々木公園 (Yoyogi Park)</a>.</p><div class=figure><p><img src=https://blog.brennan.sh/img/japan/yoyogi.jpg alt="Yoyogi park temple!"></p></div><h6 id=yoyogi-park-temple>Yoyogi park temple!</h6><p>The hightlight of my day was definity walking around these amazing shrines and torii gates. Once I was done around the harajuku area I ventured up to Shinjuku, definitely my favorite of the three areas of the city from the whole trip. I found that Shibuya was way too touristy and didn&rsquo;t feel very authentic, while Shinjuku was more authentic. I also took my first a chance to visit a <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Quijote_(store)>Don Quijote</a> while in Shinjuku which only made me wish they existed in North America.</p><div class=figure><p><img src=https://blog.brennan.sh/img/japan/downtown-two.gif alt="GIF of downtown."></p></div><p>Day two was spent doing a lot of similar things to the first day, visiting Shibuya, Shinjuku, and Harajuku. With the main difference is on day 2, I got the chance to visit Akihabara. Now i&rsquo;m not too into anime, but it&rsquo;s awesome seeing all of the huge figure shops, the billboards, and 5 story tall arcades. This is where I spent a lot of my time while in Aki, and I mean a LOT. In particular I fell in love with a game called Ongeki, a rythem game with 3 distinct sets of controls.</p><div class=figure><p><img src=https://blog.brennan.sh/img/japan/aki.png alt=Akihabara></p></div><h6 id=akihabara>Akihabara</h6><p>I actually managed to spend almost a whole day, wandering through old technology shops and arcades. Selling hundreds of classic Nintendo consoles, games, and accessories.</p><div class=figure><p><img src=https://blog.brennan.sh/img/japan/consoles.jpg alt="Old consoles for sale."></p></div><h6 id=mama-maglione>Mama Maglione</h6><h2 id=tokyo-new-years-and-hatsumōde>Tokyo: New years and Hatsumōde</h2><p>My next few days were quiet during the day and busy at night, I spend my days walking around, exploring &lsquo;hole-in-the-wall&rsquo; type places and eating good food. I spend new years with a group of people that I met on Line. A group of us stayed around downtown Shibuya while the rest went to club around the Odaiba area. All and all a very fun night spend with some great people.</p><div class=figure><p><img src=https://blog.brennan.sh/img/japan/new-years.jpg alt=Friends!></p></div><h6 id=the-best-people>The best people.</h6><p>Hatsumode is the New Years celeberation in Japan that is celebrated amongst families. It is defined as the first shrine visit of the year and is incredibly popular amongst Japanese. I was looking for a place to go, I debated visiting Meji Jingu shrine however I ended up taking a train, getting off at a random stop, and vising a shrine there.</p><p><a href=https://blog.brennan.sh/posts/japan-part-two/>Continue Reading&mldr;</a></p></div></div></div></div></div><section id=comments><div class="py-3 content"><div class=container><div class="row justify-content-center"><div class="col-sm-12 col-lg-8"><div class=comments><script src=https://utteranc.es/client.js repo issue-term=pathname label=comment theme=github-light crossorigin=anonymous async></script></div></div></div></div></div></section><script src=https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/10.2.0/highlight.min.js integrity="sha512-TDKKr+IvoqZnPzc3l35hdjpHD0m+b2EC2SrLEgKDRWpxf2rFCxemkgvJ5kfU48ip+Y+m2XVKyOCD85ybtlZDmw==" crossorigin=anonymous></script><script src=https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/10.2.0/languages/r.min.js defer></script><script src=https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/10.2.0/languages/python.min.js defer></script><script src=https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/10.2.0/languages/stan.min.js defer></script><script>window.addEventListener('load',function(){hljs.initHighlighting()},!0)</script></body></html>
