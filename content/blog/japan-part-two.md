summary: "I spent New Years 2019 in Tokyo, Japan as a rather spur of the moment travel decision. While there I fell in love with the food and made some great friends. Now over a year later, Im finally writing something about it."

## Tokyo: Odaiba and Onsens

Over the next few days I went to different shops, landmarks, and things that I saw online. Starting off the series of days with a visit to Tsukiji Fish Market and ate some of the the ever amazing Tuna Fish that it is famous for. From there I went off to start my adventures around Odaiba, an up-and-coming industrial/commercial section with massive buildings and a tonne of cool places to visit. Some of the cool places to visit are the Science Center, Team Labs Borderless, and the various statues and monuments.

The day after Odabia, I spent a day trip to visit the Tenzen Onsen in Hakone, Japan. Of all the destinations I visited during this trip, this day was easily the most interesting and the most authentic insight into the lives of native Japanese. For those who don't know, an Onsen is a communal Japanese bath house traditionally that was filled hot water funnelled from volcanic hot springs, high in mineral content, for people to bathe in. Along with the beauty of the Onsen, the surronding town of Hakone was very nice. I'm not sure but if I had to guess, this is a very "Resort" area as the shops and resturants felt like they were built for that cause.

## Tokyo: Final days

The last few days I spent visiting other smaller destinations I wanted to hit as well as re-visiting the ones that I liked the best. Including Roppingi Hills, Shinbashi, and Ginza. Three of the wealthier destinations in Tokyo. While in Roppongi, I had one thing I truly wanted to visit and that was the maman statue by Louise Bourgeois. This statue is signifigant to me because I live in Ottawa, where one of the 7 perminant statues exists, and I got to travel to the other side of the world to visit another of the 7. I also spent many more hours and thousands more yen playing Ongeki.


## Kyoto: Lots of walking

Taking the bullet train to Kyoto was an incredible experience, going 300mph on land is terrifying but oddly serene and calming. I also managed to snag a seat with a view of Mt. Fuji. Unfortunately it was a bit cloudy and this was the best view I could get.

Due to my over-stay in Tokyo, I only got a few days to spend in Kyoto but I tried my best to make the time I had. Most of the time on the first day was spend walking between the major sights and sounds of Kyoto. From the Golden Palace, to the Fushimi Inari shrine, and the Gion. There isnt much else to be said about my time in Kyoto, except to visit a bar called Beer Bar Jive. 10/10

## Food

That wraps up my experiences in Japan, however here is a small gallery of all the food I got to enjoy.
