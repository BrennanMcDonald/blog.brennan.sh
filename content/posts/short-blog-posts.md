## Your blog post can be short.<br>



<div>I've been meaning to write several blog posts for a month now, but in 5 months I've failed to produce any content. I've been trying to write about a few topics I've been passionate about since the pandemic started with no avail. My posts always felt too short to qualify as a "blog post", always feeling like I didn't have enough content to deliver or my research wasn't thorough enough. <br></div>

<div><br></div>

<div>Then I found a post submitted to HackerNews. The post was maybe 500 words, two paragraphs, but the author conveyed their message efficiently. While I disagreed with the topic, I was still able to understand the authors message in these two paragraphs. The length of a post shouldn't determine it's quality, instead the contents of the post should speak for themselves. <br></div>

<div><br></div>

<div>From now on, on this blog, I wont concern myself with the length of a post. Instead I will worry about conveying my message with efficiency; And actually writing the posts I want to write.<br></div>
