## Your blog post can be short.

I've been meaning to write several blog posts for a while, but despite having inspiration I've failed to produce any content in 5 months. I've been trying to write about a few topics I've been passionate about since the pandemic started with no avail. My posts always felt too short to qualify as a “blog post”, always feeling like I didn't have enough content to deliver or my research wasn't thorough enough.

Then I found a post submitted to HackerNews. The post was maybe 500 words, two paragraphs, but the author conveyed their message efficiently. While I disagreed with the topic, I was still able to understand the author's message in these two paragraphs. The length of a post shouldn't determine it's quality, instead, the contents of the post should speak for themselves.

From now on, on this blog, I won't concern myself with the length of a post. Instead, I will worry about conveying my message with efficiency; And actually writing the posts I want to write.
