Hi! I'm Brennan McDonald, a 4th year computer science student studying at the University of Ottawa in Canada. Knowledgeable in the art of the DOM and Frontend, I also have vast experience with a large list of topics in Computer Science. Right now I am working on expanding my knowledge in the field of DevOps, Scalability, and Cloud Computing.

This blog is going to simply be my shouting my thoughts into the void with the hope of improving my writing skills and picking up a few listeners along the way. I intend on talking about anything that comes to my mind and I hope that I can hit a topic that interestes a few people.
